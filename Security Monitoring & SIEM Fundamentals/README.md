## **1. Lab Title**
> Security Monitoring & SIEM Fundamentals: Hack The Box

---

## **2. Purpose and Objectives**
The objective of this lab is to gain hands-on experience with **SIEM operations, SOC alert triaging, and threat detection** using the Elastic Stack (Kibana & Elasticsearch).  

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Build and customize SIEM dashboards for Windows event logs.  
- Practice data filtering and correlation using Kibana Query Language (KQL).  
- Simulate SOC Tier 1 triage workflows and escalation processes.  
- Map detections to MITRE ATT&CK techniques for enhanced threat context.

---

## **3. Frameworks, Standards, and Methodologies**
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mapping.  
- **SOC Tier 1 Triage Methodologies:** Alert classification and escalation.  
- **Defense-in-Depth Principles:** Layered monitoring and detection.  

---

## **4. Tools and Technologies**
- **SIEM:** Elastic Stack (Kibana, Elasticsearch)  
- **Endpoint Monitoring:** Windows Event Logs  
- **Query Language:** Kibana Query Language (KQL)  
- **System Environment:** Windows Server / Active Directory  
- **Utilities:** PowerShell (for log review and event correlation)

<summary>Click to expand detailed steps</summary>

1. Built and customized SIEM dashboards for key Windows event logs, including failed logons, RDP activity, and group membership changes.  
2. Used KQL to filter, search, and correlate events for suspicious activity.  
3. Simulated SOC Tier 1 alert triage: classified alerts, consulted IT operations, and escalated incidents based on severity.  
4. Mapped identified detections to MITRE ATT&CK techniques to provide threat context and visibility.  
5. Validated SIEM visualizations and queries for accuracy and detection coverage.

## **6. Findings and Results**
- Successfully visualized critical Windows security events in Kibana.  
- Detected anomalies in failed logons and RDP activity patterns.  
- Mapped suspicious events to MITRE ATT&CK techniques for context-aware threat detection.  
- SOC triage workflow simulation demonstrated structured escalation and alert handling.

## **7. Analysis and Interpretation**
The lab highlighted the **value of proactive monitoring and structured SOC workflows**. MITRE ATT&CK mapping contextualized the attack techniques, while KQL queries allowed rapid filtering and correlation of large volumes of log data. This approach reinforced the importance of **real-time detection and escalation** in operational cybersecurity environments.
